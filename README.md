## Title: Mirrors of Voodoo
## Category: Script - Addon
## Game: World of Warcraft

Mirrors of Voodoo (MOV) is an add on, which enchant the default mirrors bars meaning the breath, fatigue, feign death bars etc.

You can open the options panel in two ways:
1.	With the commands: /mov and /mirrorsofvoodoo.
2.	Through the minimap buttons that Blizzard gave us. It’s a tiny number at the top-left or bottom-left of the minimap, click it and you will find it

Right now, MOV adds:
•	Timer on the mirror bar, which is movable.
•	The name of the bar became movable.
•	You can create, load, and delete a profile so you can copy/paste your settings between your characters!
